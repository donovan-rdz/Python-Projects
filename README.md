# Python Projects

A curated collection of Python scripts designed to teach fundamental programming concepts.
Each folder focuses on a specific topic (e.g., conditionals, loops, logical operators) and includes annotated examples and projects.


## Structure

- **hello-world/** – First Python script demonstrating basic output.
- **conditionals/** – Examples of decision-making with `if` / `elif` / `else`.
- **loops/** – Scripts showing repetition with `while` and `for`.
- **logical_operators/** – (future) examples of logical conditions (`and`, `or`, `not`).

## How to Run

You can run any script with Python 3:

```bash
py beginner/hello-world/main.py
