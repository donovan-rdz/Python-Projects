# Loops

This folder contains beginner Python scripts focused on understanding and practicing loops.

The goal of these exercises is to learn how repetition works in Python using `while` and `for` loops, and how loops can be combined with conditionals and user input.

## Concepts covered
- `while` loops
- `for` loops with `range()`
- Counters and iteration
- Even and odd number checks
- Basic input validation with `try / except`

## Scripts
- **01_counter_while.py** – Counts from 1 to 20 using a `while` loop.
- **02_counter_for.py** – Counts from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop and `range()`.
- **03_even_odd_loop.py** – Checks whether numbers in a range are even or odd.
- **04_age_checker_loop.py** – Checks the user's age and validates it.
- **05_number_guess_game.py** – The user have to try to guess a number with limited attempts.
