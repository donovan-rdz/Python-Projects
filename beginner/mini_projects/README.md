# Mini Projects
This folder contains small interactive Python projects that combine multiple concepts learned in the Beginner stage.

Unlike isolated exercises, these scripts are designed to:

- Simulate real program behavior
- Use loops, conditionals, and user input together
- Serve as foundations for larger applications

Each mini project focuses on logic flow, decision making, and user interaction.

## Concepts Covered
The projects in this folder may include:
- `while` loops and program control
- `if / elif / else`
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- `match / case`
- Input validation
- Simple randomness (random)
- Menu-based program structures

## Scripts
- **01_match_case_selector.py** -
- **02_interactive_menu.py** -

### Goal of This Folder
The goal of these mini projects is to:
- `Practice` combining multiple Python concepts
- `Learn` how real programs are structured
- `Prepare` for more complex projects with functions, files, and data
This folder represents the transition from learning syntax to building programs.
