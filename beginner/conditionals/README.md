# Conditionals – Python

This folder contains Python scripts focused on understanding and practicing
conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

The scripts simulate real-world decision-making scenarios where different
outcomes depend on user input and logical conditions.

---

## Concepts Covered
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`)
- User input handling
- Basic input validation
- Control flow and decision trees

---

## Scripts

### Age Validation
Checks the user's age and determines whether they are a minor or an adult.

**What it teaches:**
- Comparing numeric values
- Structuring multiple conditional branches
- Handling invalid input gracefully

---

### Number Comparer
Compares two numbers entered by the user and determines:

- If the first number is greater than the second
- If the second number is greater than the first
- Or if both numbers are equal

**What it teaches:**
- Comparing numeric values
- Writing clear conditional branches
- Handling multiple possible outcomes

---

### Even or Odd
Determines whether a number entered by the user is **even or odd**.

**What it teaches:**
- Using the modulo operator (`%`)
- Applying conditionals to mathematical logic
- Writing clean and readable decision-based code
