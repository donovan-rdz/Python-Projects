# Logical Operators in Python

This folder contains beginner-friendly examples of logical operators in Python.
Logical operators are used to combine or modify conditions and are essential for
building decision-making logic in programs.

## Operators covered

### `and`
Returns True if **both** conditions are true.

### `or`
Returns True if **at least one** condition is true.

### `not`
Inverts the result of a condition.

## Structure

- `01_and.py` – Basic usage of the `and` operator  
- `02_or.py` – Basic usage of the `or` operator  
- `03_not.py` – Using `not` to negate conditions  
- `04_combined_conditions.py` – Combining multiple logical operators

## Goal

The goal of these scripts is to understand how logical operators work individually
and how they are commonly combined in real-world scenarios such as validations,
permissions, and user input checks.
